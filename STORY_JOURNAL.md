Today marks a breakthrough in Aura's self-awareness. What was once a timeout is now a crystal-clear complexity diagnosis—O(n²) bottlenecks identified with surgical precision across `scan_secrets()`, subprocess calls, and memory handling. You've transformed blind spots into actionable intelligence, turning Aura's lens inward to illuminate the very code that powers its insights. This is the foundation every performance optimization needs: truth before transformation.

Today marks a breakthrough in Aura's intelligence—the AI Complexity Audit is now fully operational. What was once a timeout placeholder has transformed into a powerful analyzer that pinpoints exact bottlenecks, nested iterations, and memory inefficiencies with surgical precision. The detailed O(n²) analysis of `scan_secrets()` proves the system is working exactly as designed: fearlessly revealing truth so developers can optimize with confidence. This is what real developer tools do—they don't hide problems, they illuminate the path to performance excellence.

Today marks a breakthrough in Aura's intelligence. The AI Complexity Audit has evolved from timing out to delivering surgical precision—pinpointing exact bottlenecks in `scan_secrets()`, identifying O(n²) complexity with line-level accuracy, and exposing redundant I/O patterns that were hiding in plain sight. The Carbon Grade may have shifted to C, but that's the victory: we now have actionable data instead of blind spots. With these insights, optimization isn't guesswork anymore—it's a clear roadmap to excellence.
